The cost of a home is just one aspect that comes into play when calculating expenses. For many people the idea of buying a home can be either overwhelming or outside of their financial means. Renting is a good alternative that many decide is the optimal option for them. There are resources out there, such as Zillow that assist renters and home buyers alike in finding the right home. The monthly cost to rent can be affected by the unit size, location, number of bedrooms, and many other features. In addition, a unit’s proximity to venues such as restaurants, parks, night clubs, and museums may play a role in pricing and, more importantly, a renter’s interest in that location. Information relating monthly rent rates by neighborhood to nearby venues can be an important tool for renters.
